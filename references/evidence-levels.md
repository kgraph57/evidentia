# Evidence Level Assessment Guide

Hierarchical classification and assessment criteria for evaluating the quality of evidence in medical information.

## Evidence Hierarchy

### Level 1: Highest Quality Evidence

**1a. Systematic reviews / meta-analyses of multiple RCTs**

Integrated analysis of multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials. The most reliable form of evidence.

**Assessment points:**
- Quality of included studies (bias risk assessment)
- Degree of heterogeneity (I² statistic)
- Publication bias evaluation (funnel plots)
- GRADE assessment for overall quality determination

**1b. Individual large-scale RCTs**

Single, well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

**Assessment points:**
- Randomization method (adequate allocation concealment)
- Blinding quality (double-blind, single-blind, open-label)
- Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis
- Sample size adequacy (pre-calculated power analysis)
- Dropout rate and follow-up duration
- Clear distinction between primary and secondary endpoints

### Level 2: High Quality Evidence

**2a. Systematic reviews of cohort studies**

Integrated analysis of multiple prospective cohort studies.

**2b. Individual cohort studies (prospective)**

Forward-tracking studies comparing exposed and unexposed groups.

**Assessment points:**
- Adequacy of follow-up duration
- Follow-up rate (attrition)
- Confounding adjustment methods (multivariate analysis)
- Validity of exposure measurement
- Validity of outcome measurement

**2c. Case-control studies**

Retrospective comparison of cases with controls to investigate past exposures.

**Assessment points:**
- Case and control selection methods
- Matching adequacy
- Recall bias risk
- Confounding adjustment

### Level 3: Moderate Quality Evidence

**3a. Cross-sectional studies**

Studies examining exposure and outcome at a single time point. Limited ability to infer causation.

**Assessment points:**
- Sampling representativeness
- Temporal ambiguity
- Confounding influences

**3b. Case series**

Descriptive compilation of multiple similar cases. No control group limits causal inference.

**Assessment points:**
- Number of cases
- Detail of description
- Limitations on generalizability

### Level 4: Low Quality Evidence

**4a. Case reports**

Detailed description of single or few cases. Useful for hypothesis generation but not generalizable.

**Assessment points:**
- Detail and accuracy of description
- Limitations on causal inference
- Recognition of non-generalizability

**4b. Expert opinion / consensus**

Clinical experience and opinions not based on systematic research.

**Assessment points:**
- Expert qualifications and experience
- Conflicts of interest
- Consistency with other evidence

### Level 5: Lowest Quality Evidence

**5a. Animal studies / in vitro research**

Major limitations for direct human application. Useful for understanding mechanisms and generating hypotheses.

**Assessment points:**
- Physiological differences between animal species and humans
- Realism of dosage and conditions
- Limitations of extrapolation to humans

**5b. Unsupported claims / anecdotal evidence**

Claims without scientific evidence or based on personal anecdotes.

## Study Design Quality Assessment Tools

### RCT Quality: Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool

Assessment domains:
1. Random sequence generation (selection bias)
2. Allocation concealment (selection bias)
3. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)
4. Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)
5. Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
6. Selective outcome reporting (reporting bias)
7. Other sources of bias

Each domain rated: **Low risk** / **Unclear** / **High risk**

### Observational Studies: Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)

**Cohort studies** (max 9 points):
- Selection (4 points): representativeness, non-exposed selection, exposure ascertainment, outcome absence at start
- Comparability (2 points): confounding adjustment
- Outcome (3 points): outcome assessment, follow-up duration, follow-up completeness

**Case-control studies** (max 9 points):
- Selection (4 points): case definition, case representativeness, control selection, control definition
- Comparability (2 points): confounding adjustment
- Exposure (3 points): exposure ascertainment, same method for cases/controls, non-response rate

### Systematic Reviews: AMSTAR 2

Key assessment domains:
- Pre-registered research protocol
- Comprehensive literature search
- Duplicate study selection
- Duplicate data extraction
- List of excluded studies
- Detailed description of included studies
- Risk of bias assessment
- Appropriate statistical methods for meta-analysis
- Publication bias assessment
- Conflict of interest reporting

### Diagnostic Accuracy Studies: QUADAS-2

Assessment domains:
- Patient selection bias risk
- Index test bias risk
- Reference standard bias risk
- Flow and timing bias risk
- Applicability concerns

### Clinical Guidelines: AGREE II

Six quality domains:
1. **Scope and purpose** — clarity of objectives and target population
2. **Stakeholder involvement** — inclusion of relevant professional groups and patients
3. **Rigor of development** — systematic evidence search, evidence-recommendation link
4. **Clarity of presentation** — specific, unambiguous recommendations
5. **Applicability** — implementation facilitators, barriers, resource implications
6. **Editorial independence** — COI management, funding source influence

## GRADE Assessment System

Comprehensive system for evaluating overall evidence quality.

### Four Levels of Evidence Quality

1. **High**: Strong confidence that the true effect is close to the estimated effect
2. **Moderate**: Moderate confidence; the true effect is likely close to the estimate
3. **Low**: Limited confidence in the estimated effect
4. **Very low**: Very little confidence in the estimated effect

### Factors That Lower Quality

1. **Risk of bias**: Problems with study design or execution
2. **Inconsistency**: Variability across study results (heterogeneity)
3. **Indirectness**: Differences in population, intervention, comparison, or outcome from the clinical question
4. **Imprecision**: Small sample sizes or wide confidence intervals
5. **Publication bias**: Potential for unpublished negative results

### Factors That Raise Quality (for observational studies)

1. **Large effect size**: Odds ratio >2 or <0.5
2. **Dose-response gradient**: Clear relationship between exposure and effect
3. **Confounders reduce effect**: Accounting for confounders would strengthen the observed effect

## Evidence Level and Recommendation Strength

High evidence level does not automatically mean strong recommendation. Recommendation strength also considers:

1. **Balance of benefits and harms**: magnitude of effect vs. risk
2. **Patient values and preferences**: what outcomes patients prioritize
3. **Resource utilization**: cost, convenience, feasibility
4. **Evidence quality**: GRADE assessment above

## Domain-Specific Considerations

### Pediatrics
- **Age stratification**: neonates, infants, toddlers, school-age, adolescents have different physiology
- **Adult data extrapolation**: Limited by developmental differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
- **Ethical constraints**: Higher barriers for conducting RCTs in children
- **Rare diseases**: Large-scale RCTs often infeasible
- **Long-term outcomes**: Growth and developmental impacts must be considered

### Oncology
- **Surrogate endpoints**: Progression-free survival vs. overall survival distinction
- **Biomarker-driven trials**: Smaller, targeted populations
- **Rapidly evolving therapies**: Immunotherapy, targeted therapy evidence base changes quickly

### Emergency Medicine
- **Time-sensitive decisions**: May require acting on lower-quality evidence
- **Pragmatic trials**: Real-world effectiveness vs. explanatory trial efficacy
- **Consent challenges**: Ethical complexities in emergency research

### Mental Health
- **Blinding challenges**: Difficult to blind behavioral interventions
- **Subjective outcomes**: Patient-reported outcomes require validated instruments
- **Placebo effects**: Often large in psychiatric trials

## Practical Evaluation Workflow

1. **Identify study design**: RCT, cohort, case-control, etc.
2. **Set initial evidence level**: Based on study design
3. **Assess quality**: Using appropriate tool (Cochrane RoB, NOS, QUADAS-2, etc.)
4. **Apply GRADE**: Consider factors that raise or lower quality
5. **Determine final evidence level**: Comprehensive judgment
6. **Consider recommendation strength**: Integrate evidence with clinical factors
